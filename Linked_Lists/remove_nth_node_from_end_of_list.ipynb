    "Two pointers make it easier to find the (n+1)th node from the end (since this is the node for which we will modify the next pointer). To do so, we only need to make sure the `left` pointer starts at `Null` (before the first node of the linked list), and the `right` pointer a distance of (n+1) ahead of `left`, so that when `right` reaches the end, the `left` pointer is right where we want it.\n",
