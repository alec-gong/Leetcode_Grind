    "This problem is trivial if we know the process. After building a stack, we iterate the list. When we encounter operands, we add them to the stack; when we encounter operators, we pop two operands after the stack (order: right operand, left operand) and perform the corresponding calculation, adding the result back to the stack. When we finish iterating through the list, we pop the result from the stack."
