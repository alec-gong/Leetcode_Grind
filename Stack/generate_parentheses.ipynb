    "1. The base case: if we have encountered `n` open and close parentheses, we have constructed a valid answer, which we add to `res`.\n",
    "2. Recusion: as long as the opening parentheses we encountered are less than n, we can keep adding `(` to the answer. Meanwhile, we must make sure the closing parentheses are **no more** than the opening parentheses. If the former is fewer than the letter, the balance can be restored by keep adding `)`."
