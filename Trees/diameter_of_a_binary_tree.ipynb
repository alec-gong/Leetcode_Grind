    "We define a method called `radius`, which finds the **radius** of a node in a binary tree. The *radius* is the height of node *plus one*. And for every node, if we know its radius on the left and on the right, we can calculate its diameter by summing up the radii together. Afterwards, we can update the longest radius if applicable."
