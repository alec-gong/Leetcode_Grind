    "Determine if a 9 x 9 Sudoku board is valid. Only the filled cells need to be validated according to the following rules:\n",
    "1. Each row must contain the digits 1-9 without repetition.\n",
    "2. Each column must contain the digits 1-9 without repetition.\n",
    "3. Each of the nine 3 x 3 sub-boxes of the grid must contain the digits 1-9 without repetition.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Method 1: Brute Force\n",
    "Since we are evaluating the validity by **units of 9** (rows/columns/squares), it is natural to think of writing a helper method that evalutes if a unit is valid (if 1-9 appears in this unit at most once).\n",
    "\n",
    "We create an initially empty list. If a number appears for the first time, we add it to the list. If it appears for the second time (this number already exists in the list), then it breaks the rule and the unit is invalid. "

    "## Method 3: The Elegant Way\n",
    "\n",
    "This method is much more elegant than previous ones in two ways.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The method iterates through every element in the sudoku only once. The idea is, for every element, it can only exist in its respective row, column, and square only once. So we are performing **three** checks at the same time. This will require us to store more than one hash set at any given time (in fact, we will have 9*3=27 hash sets). \n",
    "    \n",
    "    To create the hash sets, we import `defaultdict` class from the `collections` module. It creates an instance of `defaultdict` by calling `collections.defaultdict(set)`. `defaultdict` is just like a dictionary except that it provides a default value for missing keys,simplifying certain operations. Here, the values of `defaultdict` is made up of hash sets.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. The method greatly simplifies the process of attributing elements to its respective squares. The idea here is that the board can be broken down into nine small squares, and each square can by charactized by row and column index of 0, 1, 2. And to determine the row and column index of the square any element belongs to, we only need to perform a `//` operation to find the dividend. \n",
