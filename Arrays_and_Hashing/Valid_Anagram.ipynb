    "# Valid Anagram\n",

    "### Question\n",
    "Given two strings `s` and `t`, return `true` if `t` is an anagram of `s`, and `false` otherwise.\n",
    "An **Anagram** is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of a different word or phrase, typically using all the original letters exactly once.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Method: Using a HashMap\n",
    "This follows the idea of **Two Sums**. Create a dictionary storing the number of occurances of every unique letter in `s`. Then modify the counts in the dictionary based on the frequency of the unique letters in `t`. Then verify the counts, only returning true if every value is 0."
