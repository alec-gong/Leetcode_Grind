    "# Contains Duplicates\n",

    "### Question\n",
    "Given an integer array `nums`, return `true` if *any* value appears **at least twice** in the array, and return `false` if every element is distinct.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Method: Dictionary Strikes Again\n",
    "We create a dictionary, storing each unique number as its keys. Every time we encounter a new unique number, we create an entry, setting 1 as the value to indicate the number has only appeared once. \n",
    "\n",
    "However, we do **not** need to increment the values, because if a number is already in the dictionary, the next time we encounter it, we know the list contains duplicates, and we can just return `True`. If after looping through all the numbers in the list, the program has not terminated, then we know there are no duplicates, and can immediately return `True`."
