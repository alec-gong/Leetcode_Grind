    "# Group Anagrams\n",

    "### Question\n",
    "Given an array of strings `strs`, group the **anagrams** together. You can return the answer in **any order**.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Method 1: The Brute Force Approach\n",
    "This problem directly follows from *Valid Anagram*. The first instinct is to recycle the solution for that problem to compare if two words are anagrams. \n",
    "\n",
    "The challenge is to scale this operation to a list of words. It is a bad idea to compare every two words; in fact, for every group of words which are anagrams, we only need to compare the next word to one of the words in the group.\n",
    "\n",
    "Consequently, we want to create a dictionary. We store the words which are anagrams as the value in the form of a list, and choose one of the words as the key. For every new word, if `isAnagram` method returns true, then it is added to the values; else, we create a new entry, with the word serving both as the key and value. "

    "The trickiest part is to determine whether the new word should be added to an existing entry or as a new entry. To that end, we create the boolean flag `pair`, which is originally set to `False`. If after looping through all the keys in the dictionary, the flag remains unchanged, then the word is a new entry. Otherwise, if during the loop, it finds its anagrams, the flag is switched to the opposite. To save time, the `break` terminates the loop immediately. \n",
