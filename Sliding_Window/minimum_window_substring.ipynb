    "\n",
    "As most sliding window problems, we keep track of each letter's apperances using a dictionary. But unlike other problems, when comparing two dictionaries, the requirements are less strict: for every letter in `t`, we only need to make sure the same letters in the substring of `s` appears no fewer times. For comparison purposes, we build `isGood` method following the above logic. \n",
    "\n",
    "For the actual sliding window, we keep moving the right pointer until we have found a substring that satifies the requirements, and we start moving the left pointer, shrinking the window until the substring is no longer valid. We keep track of the length of the substring, updating `length` if a new minimum is found, and storing the left, right pointer in `ans`."
